# TensorFlow
This directory contains all the necessary files for training and quantizing MobileNetV2 and TinyCNN models using TensorFlow. It includes the following files:

1. [mobileNetV2.py](mobileNetV2.py) - Contains the code for initializing, training, quantizing and exporting a MobileNetV2 model.

2. [tinyCnn.py](tinyCnn.py) - Contains the code for initializing, training, quantizing and exporting a TinyCNN model.

3. [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) - Contains all the necessary packages required for the Python scripts along with their versions.

# Getting started
Assuming that a virtual environment already exists and is activated, the code can be run using:
```bash
python mobileNetV2.py
```
```bash
python tinyCnn.py
```
